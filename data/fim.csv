AEON Scholarship Since 2006, AEON 1% Club Foundation has helped university and graduate school students in Asia achieve their dreams through providing scholarship. Including 36 Cambodian students, the program has supported a total of 4,393 Asian students, of which 562 are studying in Japan. They are expected to serve as a bridge between Cambodia and Japan. 2. School Construction Support Project The project is to support construction of schools in Asian countries with inadequate educational facilities. Started in 2000, the project has helped construct a total of 393 schools in Cambodia, Nepal, Laos, Vietnam, and Myanmar. In Cambodia, the project assisted in building 149 primary schools in Kampong Thom Province, Prey Veng Province, Kampong Speu Province, Stung Treng Province, and Siem Reap Province providing educational opportunities for more than 200,000 Cambodian children. 3. Teenage Ambassadors The Teenage Ambassadors program is an exchange activity designed to promote mutual understanding among high school students from Japan and those overseas. Through a week-long program in which students make courtesy visits to the host country’s government and embassies, attend classes at local school and experience homestay, the program offers opportunities for students to build friendship as well as cultivating international perspective. So far, 2,052 high school students from 17 countries have participated in the program. The program was held three times in 2000, 2012 and 2015 with overall participation of 120 Cambodian and Japanese students. 4. AEON-UNICEF Safe Water Campaign In regions of Cambodia where there is a shortage of safe water, the children have to sacrifice time they could otherwise spend attending school to fetch water far away for daily use. The campaign was launched in 2010 to build water-supply facilities in villages for the children, and has helped some 130,000 children in Asia secure safe drinking water and educational opportunities. 5. Support for Sihanouk-Aeon Museum AEON 1% Club Foundation donated to build Sihanouk-Aeon Museum, which stands adjacent to the Angkor Wat, for preservation and research of the Pillar of a thousand Buddhas and 274 Buddhist statues that were discovered from the remains of Banteay Kdei temple in Cambodia.

These include the donation of $3 million twice by our Chairman to help Cambodia purchase 1 million vaccines to combat the COVID-19 epidemic, donating 110,000 PPE (hospital gowns) to aid the government’s vaccination drive for Phnom Penh, as well as the organization of several rounds of vaccination to ensure that all 3,500+ Prince employees are protected.
More recently, the Foundation is especially pleased to launch the Chen Zhi Scholarship, an annual scholarship scheme in conjunction with Cambodia’s Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport that offers full scholarships, stipends, internship, and work opportunities to 400 Cambodian university students over a period of seven years. In total, Prince Group will provide over $2 million across seven years.
